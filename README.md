# Meme Generator

A React application that generates memes with custom text overlays. This project was created as part of the Scrimba React course to practice working with side effects and the useEffect hook.

## Description

This meme generator allows users to create custom memes by fetching random meme templates from an external API and overlaying user-provided text. The application demonstrates practical use of React hooks, specifically useEffect for handling API calls and managing component side effects.

## Features

- Fetches random meme images from an external API
- Allows users to input custom top and bottom text
- Generates memes with text overlays on button click
- Built with React functional components and hooks

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5
- CSS3
